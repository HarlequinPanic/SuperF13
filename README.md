# SuperF13
A remake of the NES Friday The 13th in python scripting langauge

Lets get a list of what I want the game to carry over from the old version on NES and what I think it will need:

-Three modes of play:  Action platformer, punch out cabin exploring, rowing

-Zombies and non-Jason enemies: are they really necessary?  

-Make the game more about resource management than originally done:
  -How to do that?
